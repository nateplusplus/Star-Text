Symbol Stars
============

This experimental code snippet is part of a larger project in an effort
to create a bunch of stars out of ancient symbols. My goal is to create
a star effect using CSS box shadows, gradients and animations.

It's a work in progress... right now it is fairly simple.

I promise it will be better.
